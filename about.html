							<h1>Nicolas Naugle</h1>
							<h3>Computer Engineering Major - University of Florida</h3>
							<h3>Vision: To never stop learning and striving in the field of engineering and in life.</h3>
							<h3>Career Interests: To utilize the skills I've gained to work on computer engineering projects, perferably for military application.</h3>
					
							<h3>I was born and raised in Tampa, FL. I attended Hillsborough Community College for two years before transferring to the University of Florida in January, 2014. Since then, I have learned to code in Java, C, C++, VHDL, VBScript, HTML, and CSS. I will graduate December, 2016. In my free time, I enjoy cooking, coding, and working out, including weight lifting, biking, and playing soccer and football. My personal coding projects started out as simple games, mainly to get more aqainted with programming. My current project is to take a Raspberri Pi and build and program it, and the necessary parts, into a quadcopter.</h3>
