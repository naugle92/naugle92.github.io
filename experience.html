								I was to use my Java experience to help complete a new JDBC driver that the company wanted to use in order to make query times for the company data much faster.
							</h3>
							<h3>I added functionality for the new JDBC driver and also manipulated the source files of the reporting tool using the driver.</h3>
							<h3>I then tested the new tool on small scale queries and found that query times were reduced by nearly 50%.</h3>
